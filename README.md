# Sonarr Installer
This will donwload all dependences, install Sonarr, and set it to start at bootup. It is essentially the instructions at  https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/wiki/Installation-CentOS-7 thrown in a script. (If you trust me) You can run it with: 
```bash curl -sSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/2acb889551b0c1908f8b4999b8e7120f/raw/5a93680c524c54fe806161077ed318f23b1454cd/sonarrSetup.sh | bash ```
