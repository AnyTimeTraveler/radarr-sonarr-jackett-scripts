# Sonarr Installer
This will donwload all dependences, install Sonarr, and set it to start at bootup. It is essentially the instructions at  https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/wiki/Installation-CentOS-7 thrown in a script. There is no error checking. (If you trust me) You can run it with: 
``` curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamson10/stuff/master/sonarr_installer.sh | bash ```
